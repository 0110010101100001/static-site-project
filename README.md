1. JavaScript is a functional and OOP language
2. HTML5 is only a markup language like this readme
3. CSS3 is only a styling language

`console.log("hello, world")`  
`print("hello, world")`  
`printf("hello, world")`  
```

#### Descrition:
###### I have a bias towards HTML5 and CSS3. In my minds eye I see a lack of programming constructs in them. There is no recursion here, no abstraction, no loops. There's no compiler yelling to me.

>*"...recall, retrieval, practice..."*

###### I have a bias. I don't want to have it. I know there's a lot of well paid developers that only specialize in front-end technologies. I want to master it all.

>*"...routine, frogs, interleaving..."*

###### I am a Full-Stack developer. I am everywhere digitally and no where physically. I am a developer. I. am.

>*"...mnemonics, exercise, sleep..."*

I'm going to make this journey as easy as possible. This project is designed by me to facilitate a continued understanding of fundamental web development languages that are present in modern frameworks. This career path is always evolving. I like the idea of learning as it evolves making me more efficient

For now, this is my final project in CS50. **I intend to implement what I learned here back into the last three pset problems involving styling and markup languages.** I definitely prefer software engineering in the back-end. For now, this will be good practice on the front-end.

Specifically I will make a static page web site. The content isn't as important as how I instruct the client using the markup and styling languages. HTML5 and CSS3 are the main focus. What tags/ attributes should I use? What styling gets the desired effect?

##### Description Notes

1. I'll start with a wireframe drawn up on my phone using a stylus. 
2. I'll set up my ide/ git repository/ and any and all tools I think I'll need and download the rest later so that my workflow follows best practices.
3. I'll develop the site and test it using node.js. 
4. I will then move it from a prototyping environment to a deployment environment
5. I'll settle on the hosting site when I get to it
6. I expect to take about a week to finish this site, styling and modifying the previous sites as well
7. I will turn in this project as a [link to the repository](https://github.com/0110010101100001/static-site-project) and another to the live site.
8. I'll continue onto next year with more learning, projects, hackathons, open source code contributions, and networking
9. By this time next year I expect to be in the industry and paid
10. **No imposter syndrom here. I. am. confident.**
